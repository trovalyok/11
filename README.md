The user enters the number of cats.

We place the cats in a huge circle. At first, none of the cats has a hat. We go around the circle the number of times the user entered, always starting at the same place, the first cat (cat #1). Every time we stop by a cat, we either put a hat on it if it isn't wearing one, or take it off if it is.

In the first round, we stop at each cat, putting a hat on each.
In the second round, we only stop at every other cat (#2, #4, #6, #8, etc.).
In the third round, we stop only at every third cat (#3, #6, #9, #12, etc.).
We continue this process until we have made a given number of rounds around the cats.

The program displays which cats have hats at the end.

In the provided algorithm:
The outer loop iterates from 1 to r.
The inner loop iterates from j to n with a step size of j.
In each iteration of the inner loop, the value of i increments by j, effectively making the inner loop run n/j times.

So, the total number of iterations of the inner loop can be calculated as follows:
For j = 1, the inner loop runs n times.
For j = 2, the inner loop runs n/2 times.
For j = 3, the inner loop runs n/3 times.
...
For j = r, the inner loop runs n/r times.

Summing up all these iterations, we get:
n + n/2 + n/3 + ... + n/r = n * (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/r)

This sum is known as the harmonic series, and it grows logarithmically with r. Therefore, the complexity of the provided algorithm is O(n * log r).
